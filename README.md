# Hanzo

Hanzo is a Ruby library that allows a team to easily share environment endpoints for Heroku apps.

## Installation

Add this line to your application’s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hanzo'
```

## Usage

Create an `.heroku-remotes` file at the root of your app.

```yaml
qa: heroku-app-name-qa
staging: heroku-app-name-staging
production: heroku-app-name-production
```

### Install remotes

```bash
> bundle exec hanzo install

-----> Creating git remotes
       Adding qa

Once all your environments are activated, you might want to enable some
Heroku labs feature for all your environments.

```bash
> be hanzo install labs

-----> Activating Heroku Labs
