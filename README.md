# Hanzo

Hanzo is a Ruby library that allows a team to easily share environment endpoints for Heroku apps.

## Installation

Add this line to your application’s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hanzo'
```

## Usage

Create an `.heroku-remotes` file at the root of your app.

```yaml
qa: heroku-app-name-qa
staging: heroku-app-name-staging
production: heroku-app-name-production
```

### Install remotes

```bash
> bundle exec hanzo install

-----> Creating git remotes
       Adding qa
       Adding staging
       Adding production
```

### Add a new environment

This will prompt an interactive form based on the `.env.default` file
located at the root of your project.

```bash
> bundle exec hanzo add qa

-----> Creating new environment
       Heroku app name: app_name
-----> Adding git remote
-----> Setting up environment
       AWS_S3_ACCESS_ID:
       AWS_S3_SECRET_KEY:
       ...
```

### Deploy a branch or a tag

```bash
> bundle exec hanzo deploy qa

-----> Branch to deploy: |HEAD|
```
